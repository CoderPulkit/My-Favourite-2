        <h4 id="inf">My favorite hobby is playing video games. Yes, you might be thinking “How does gaming reduce your stress levels”. I’ll explain how. You see in a world full of competitiveness, I have found my passion and named it my hobby. Playing video games helps me to release my stress, also it relaxes me from a hard and long day of school/work. No, I am talking about the games that actually help you to understand this hard world a lot better. I am talking about competitive gaming. People from all over the world, gamers gathering around in an area, being shouted on, and cheered by a few millions of gamers, what’s better than that? Competitive gaming not only helps in actually competing but also develops a sense of “Being the best” in one. I would almost spend 20 mins playing video games each day.</h4>
